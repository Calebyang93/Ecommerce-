# Ecommerce-
Gatsby 
 Quick start
Create a Gatsby site.

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

# create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
Start developing.

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

cd my-blog-starter/
gatsby develop
Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial.

Open the my-blog-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
